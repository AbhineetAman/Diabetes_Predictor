# DIABETES PREDICTOR:
## A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL DEVELOPED USING FLASK DEPLOYED ON HEROKU

Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, **all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage**

Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

ALGORITHMS USED:

A number of common classification algorithms like _SVM,Decision Tree,Logistic Regression,KNN,GaussianNB_ along with ensemble algorithms like _Random Forest Classifier_ were used and the model with best accuracy(in this case precision score) was finally considered for doing the predictions.
